// Anibal, feel free to add your Node class here. It is convention to have the first letter
// of a class capitilized. 

// Once you copy your code in here scroll down and put in a short description title where 
// it has ghosted " Update Node.java" in the textbox.

// Then hit commit. Once you do this, it'll save over the existing file. However, this is
// the power of git and Github. Here on Github it will have a VERSION history saved. This 
// allows us to go back in time and see what has changed within an individual class. We will
// be able to see every change this way. i.e. version control. 

// If we mess up code we can simply look at the history and pull an old file.

// My bad
// Forgot to put a an Update description below to help be more clear.
// :)
